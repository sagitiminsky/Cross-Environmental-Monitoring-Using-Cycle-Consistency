# Cross-Environmental-Monitoring-Using-Cycle-Consistency
A python toolbox based on PyTorch which utilized neural network for rain estimation and classification from commercial microwave link (CMLs) data. This toolbox provides 4 main tools:
1. API gateway to the Israeli Metereological servoce
2. Scrapping tool for the Daily measurement explorer: A TAU hosted site which saves all the cellular data
3. Visualization of the positioning of gauges and CML stations across Israel
4. A cyclce consistency GAN frame work which allows us to map the rain domain to attenuation romain and vise versa.


# Projects Structure
1. DME scrapping
2. Utilization of IMS API
3. Preprocessing
4. Visualization
5. Metrics
6. Robustness

# Dataset
The collection of datasets that were used for training the model can be found at: [Datasets](s3://cellenmon)
Please note that the dataset are not publicly available. To gain access to the bucket please open an issue.

# Usage
The following examples:


# Model Zoo
In this project we supply a set of trained networks in our [Model Zoo](s3://cellenmon/model-zoo/).
