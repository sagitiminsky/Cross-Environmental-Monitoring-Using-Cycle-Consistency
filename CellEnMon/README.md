**run scrapers:**
go to: libs/scrappers

dme - daily measurement exploere
ims - israeli meteorological service

results will be saved to relics/datasets

**preform preprocessing**
go to: libs/preprocessing

run extractor

this will go over the CSVs saved in relics/dataset
and create pickle files for later use
