Dataset manager will allow you to download to you local system, previously uploaded datasets (for exmaple ims or dme). This might save you a lot of time if someone else already prepared the data for you.

TLDT: sh `ðŸ“„ CellEnMon/dataset_manager.sh`

<br/>

You can select multiple parameters in order to download the proper dataset
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ CellEnMon/dataset_manager.sh
```shell
ðŸŸ© 1      DB="ims" # dme | ims
â¬œ 2      START_DATE="01012013"
â¬œ 3      END_DATE="31122015"
â¬œ 4      TYPE="raw" # raw | processed
```

<br/>

make sure to ask the system admin to add you to the gcp project (where the dataset are currently hosted). Without authentication the script will fail.
